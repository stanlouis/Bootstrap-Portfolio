            <p class="mt-0">My first computer was the Apple Macintosh SE M5011. I hardly knew what to do with it at first, yet, my fascination with computers knew no bounds. I still remember the excitement and apprehension I felt after I built my first PC. I pressed the power button, waited and hoped that the computer would boot. Soon after I  regularly read articles from <a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/tech">howstuffworks.com</a> - particularly anything related to the inner workings of a computer. In 2006 I received a Bachelors of science in computer science from Hawaii Pacific University. Due to family constraints, I stayed away from the field for a while, watching from afar how the landscape was constantly evolving. I could not stay away for too long. I found myself being like a kid in a candy store looking at all the different topics I could learn, all the different paths that are interconnected but vast enough that a focus choice was necessary.

            <p>I have started my journey toward becoming a full-stack web developer. Web Development has been changing at a very fast pace in past decade. As I look forward to learn and grow with the many innovations while mastering the fundamentals, one thing I know for sure is that I will never stop learning and will continue to be amazed by this exciting field.</p>
